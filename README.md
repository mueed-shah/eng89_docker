<h2> What is Docker? </h2>

Docker is an open platform that is used for running applications and packaging them into containers. It seperates applications from the infrastructure to deliver software quickly. Applications can run in a isolated environmentm (containers) these are leightweight and contain everything needed to run an app so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.

<h2> Why use Docker vs VM </h2>

**Docker** containers are isolated and dont require hardware hpyervisor. Therefore containers are much smaller and require less resources than  a VM. It is also a lot faster and the containers can be shared across teams saving time and eliminating `works on my machine` errors.

**VMs** tools are easier to access and simpler to work with whereas Docker has a more complicated ecosystem that conists of docker-managed and third-party tools.


<h2> Why should we use docker vs VMs </h2>

**Paypal uses Docker** to drive a "cost efficiency and enterprise-grade-security" for its infrastructure. Docker has helped reduce the numbers of VMs it needs to run.

**Application development**: Docker is primarily used to package an applicationâ€™s code and its dependencies. The same container can be shared from Dev to QA and later to IT, thus bringing portability to the development pipeline.

**Running microservices applications**: Docker lets you run each microservice that makes up an application in its own container. In this way, it enables a distributed architecture.
